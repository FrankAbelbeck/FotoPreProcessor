I created this program because I needed a frontend for exiftool. Existing
solutions did not satisfy my needs.

FotoPreProcessor is distributed in the hope that it will help other people with
similar problems. In the end --after you have approved exiftool execution-- this
program will alter your images!

So please be cautious! I seek perfection, but I cannot verify the program's
behaviour due to the overwhelming number of possible platform configurations.

Having a (preferably read-only) backup of your raw footage is generally a good
idea before starting to process your images.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program displays images found in a directory and allows metadata editing.

Orientation:         Modify the EXIF tag, no image data will be altered.

GeoTagging:          Set latitude, longitude, elevation; it is also possible to use
                     OpenStreetMap for Geo browsing.

Timezone Correction: Shift timestamp from camera timezone to local time.
                     My camera is set to UTC, so I only need to know where
                     a foto was taken to get the correct time -- without
                     DST confusion. A UTC timestamp will be written to the
                     GPS timestamp, regardless of any GeoTagging.

Keywords:            Assign/modify keywords/tags. Every keyword will be stored
                     in a UTF-8 text file and will be used for word completion.
                     This shall assure that one uses a uniform set of keywords.

Copyright Notice:    Modify the image's copyright tag. I don't mind if other
                     people use images I took+published. Publish is the magic
                     word, because in that case I want other people to see it.
                     But at least I want to be mentioned as creator.

Filename:            When the changes are applied, the filename is set to
                        YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS[-i]-CameraModel.EXT
                     Local time is used, and an optional index i is added if
                     images have the same timestamp.

After editing, the user can choose to apply the changes that were made. The
program will present the exiftool commands that will be neccessary, so that the
user is able to abort the process.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which programs and libraries are needed?
(In parantheses: Gentoo Linux versions this program was created/tested with)

Python   (3.3.5)
pytz     (2014.10)
exiftool (9.78)
PyQt4    (4.11.3)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation (Deprecated, Program Tarballs are not Updated Anymore)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Extract the archive FotoPreProcessor.tar.gz to a directory accessible/writable
by your user, e.g. to ~/programs:

mkdir -p ~/programs
tar -xvzf FotoPreProcessor.tar.gz -C ~/programs

A directory "FotoPreProcessor" will be created, e.g. ~/programs/FotoPreProcessor

Inside this directory there will be an executable named FotoPreProcessor.py.

This initial version is not designed to integrate into the LSB and expects both
exiftool and file to reside in the directory /usr/bin. I will add an appropriate
installation routine and a settings dialog in the future...

Changelog
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2012-08-10: initial release as "works for me" version

2012-08-22: introduction of an icon for FPP,
            improved command line parsing,
            implementation of the settings dialog,
            usage of QSettings for configuration parameters and databases,
            handling of initial configuration,
            handling of wrong program paths (disabling features if neccessary)
            implementation of about dialogs,
            improved image import algorithm,
            improved event handling and dialog response during import/export,
            local zoneinfo table as fallback (removes zoneinfo dependency),
            elimination of quirks/bugs

2012-10-18: bugfixes (icon size preferences are correctly applied;
            slashes in camera name string are ignored during renaming),
            improvements (flickering during image list update got reduced;
            if a dock gets disabled while selecting multiple images it stays
            disabled until the selection is reset)

2015-06-29: incorporation of many small fixes,
            update to Python3,
            new search option for the geolocator,
            update of README and zone.tab,
            removal of tarball creation commands inside Makefile,
            transition to GitHub

2015-07-01: further Python3 porting, improvement of arg handling,
            updated translation

2015-10-25: some fixes; changes can now be saved/loaded for delayed application,
            upgrade to new signal/slot mechanism, file naming is now configurable
