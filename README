I created this program because I needed a frontend for exiftool. Existing
solutions did not satisfy my needs.

FotoPreProcessor is distributed in the hope that it will help other people with
similar problems. In the end --after you have approved exiftool execution-- this
program will alter your images!

So please be cautious! I seek perfection, but I cannot verify the program's
behaviour due to the overwhelming number of possible platform configurations.

Having a (preferably read-only) backup of your raw footage is generally a good
idea before starting to process your images.

Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program displays images found in a directory and allows metadata editing.

Orientation:         Modify the EXIF tag, no image data will be altered.

GeoTagging:          Set latitude, longitude, elevation; it is also possible to use
                     OpenStreetMap for Geo browsing.

Timezone Correction: Shift timestamp from camera timezone to local time.
                     My camera is set to UTC, so I only need to know where
                     a foto was taken to get the correct time -- without
                     DST confusion. A UTC timestamp will be written to the
                     GPS timestamp, regardless of any GeoTagging.

Keywords:            Assign/modify keywords/tags. Every keyword will be stored
                     in a UTF-8 text file and will be used for word completion.
                     This shall assure that one uses a uniform set of keywords.

Copyright Notice:    Modify the image's copyright tag. I don't mind if other
                     people use images I took+published. Publish is the magic
                     word, because in that case I want other people to see it.
                     But at least I want to be mentioned as creator.

Filename:            When the changes are applied, the filename is set to
                        YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS[-i]-CameraModel.EXT
                     Local time is used, and an optional index i is added if
                     images have the same timestamp.

After editing, the user can choose to apply the changes that were made. The
program will present the exiftool commands that will be neccessary, so that the
user is able to abort the process.

Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which programs and libraries are needed?
(In parantheses: versions this program was created/tested with)

Python   (2.7)
pytz     (2012c)
exiftool (8.900.0)
PyQt4    (4.9.1)
file     (5.11)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Extract the archive FotoPreProcessor.tar.gz to a directory accessible/writable
by your user, e.g. to ~/programs:

mkdir -p ~/programs
tar -xvzf FotoPreProcessor.tar.gz -C ~/programs

A directory "FotoPreProcessor" will be created, e.g. ~/programs/FotoPreProcessor

Inside this directory there will be an executable named FotoPreProcessor.py.

This initial version is not designed to integrate into the LSB and expects both
exiftool and file to reside in the directory /usr/bin. I will add an appropriate
installation routine and a settings dialog in the future...
